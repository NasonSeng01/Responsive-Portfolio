        <p>
          I was born in Richmond, VA born on July 3rd of 1998. My parents both
          originated from Cambodia which borders Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. I
          graduated from Hermitage High School and started at least one semester
          at J. Sargent Reynolds. My major is computer science and I am also
          trying to major in computer programming.

          In junior year of my high school I got my first job at Carmax, which I
          had thought was a big step towards a great future. After 2 years I
          felt that I have accomplished nothing that I aspired to be. In late
          October a coworker of mine told me about a "Coding Bootcamp" that his
          friend just graduated from and he had an amazing experience. I needed
          to take the next step in my life and pursue my dreams.
